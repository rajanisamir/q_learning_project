# q_learning_project

## Implementation Plan

### Team Members: Samir Rajani and Jason Chee

### Descriptions of Components

**Q-learning algorithm**
- Executing the Q-learning algorithm
- Determining when the Q-matrix has converged
- Once the Q-matrix has converged, how to determine which actions the robot should take to maximize expected reward

**Robot perception**
- Determining the identities and locations of the three colored objects
- Determining the identities and locations of the three AR tags

**Robot manipulation & movement**
- Picking up and putting down the colored objects with the OpenMANIPULATOR arm
- Navigating to the appropriate locations to pick up and put down the colored objects

### Timeline
_We aim to have components implemented by the following times:_

**Q-learning algorithm**
- Executing the Q-learning algorithm: Wednesday, April 27th
- Determining when the Q-matrix has converged: Thursday, April 28th
- Once the Q-matrix has converged, how to determine which actions the robot should take to maximize expected reward: Saturday, April 30th

**Robot perception**
- Determining the identities and locations of the three colored objects: Monday, May 2nd
- Determining the identities and locations of the three AR tags: Tuesday, May 3rd

**Robot manipulation & movement**
- Picking up and putting down the colored objects with the OpenMANIPULATOR arm: Wednesday, May 4th
- Navigating to the appropriate locations to pick up and put down the colored objects: Thursday, May 5th

We will use the remaining time to perform further tests of our implementation and to tie up any loose ends.
